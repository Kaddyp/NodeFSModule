/**************** File System Module and Express.js **************************/
var fs = require("fs");
// Synchronous Form
1. It block the execution of next line in program and wait till the task associated with file is completed
2. It uses Sync key-word(in syntax)
3. Least preferred due to blocking 
4. Eg. fs.readFileSync('input text')

// Asynchronous Form
1. It does not block the execution of program and executes the program without waiting for the completion of the task associated with file
2. It uses callback function
3. Most preferred due to non-blocking 
4. Eg. fs.readFile('input text', function(err, data){})
